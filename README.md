# LRGS - Lightweight Responsive Grid System

A normal css grid system for basic projects. The reason I'm creating this is because I like to have full control of my own code. I will also just add the bare essentials to make this grid work properly, no bloat that slows it down.

##TODO: 
1. Support column offset.
2. Add optional styles.
3. Add pre-made website layouts.
